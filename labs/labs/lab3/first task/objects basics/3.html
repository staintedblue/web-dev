            // whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc – are always copied “as a whole value”

            // a variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its "address in memory" – in other words "a reference" to it

            // the object is stored somewhere in memory (at the right of the picture), while the user variable (at the left) has a "reference" to it

            // when an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated

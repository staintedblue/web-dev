            // a primitive : 
            // 1. a value of a primitive type
            // 2. there are 7 primitive types : string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol, null and undefined

            // an object :
            // 1. capable of storing multiple values as properties
            // 2. can be created with {}, there are other kinds of objects in JavaScript : functions, for example, are objects

            // one of the best things about objects is that we can store a function as one of its properties
